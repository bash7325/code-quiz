Created a timed JavaScript quiz to test myself and others on the fundamentals.

# Criteria met

- When start button clicked, you are presented with a question and the timer starts
- When I answer a question, you are presented with the next question
- When I answer a question incorrectly, time is deducted
- When all questions are answered or the time is up, the quiz ends
- When the game is over, I am able to save my score and name
